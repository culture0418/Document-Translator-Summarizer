Ukraine said all 18 missiles were shot down and footage showed air defences destroying targets over the city.
But Russia said its attack - which used drones and missiles - had hit all its targets.
Moscow has stepped up its air campaign in recent weeks, ahead of an expected Ukrainian offensive.
The air raid alert sounded at around 02:30 local time (23:30 GMT Monday) and was lifted two hours later in the eighth attack to hit the capital this month.
An unusually high number of loud explosions was heard in the city centre, as authorities told residents in online messages that air defence had been activated.
The head of Ukraine's armed forces, Valerii Zaluzhny, said Russia attacked Kyiv from the north, south and east and that 18 air, sea and land-based missiles had been used.
Serhiy Popko, head of the Ukrainian capital's military administration, described the barrage as being the "maximum number of attack missiles in the shortest period of time".
"According to preliminary information, the vast majority of enemy targets in the airspace of Kyiv were detected and destroyed," he added.
Gen Zaluzhny said that included nine Kalibr cruise missiles, which were launched from ships in the Black Sea, and three land-based missiles.
He added that Kyiv also destroyed six Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, which are capable of reaching speeds of more than 11,000kmh (7,000mph).
Russia has claimed in the past that these could not be taken out by any of the world's air defence systems.
Hypersonic weapons are harder to defend against because of their speed as well as the fact they fly at low altitudes - beyond the line of sight of ground-based radars - and can manoeuvre mid-flight.
Ukraine said it had shot down a Kinzhal for the first time last week during an earlier attack on Kyiv.
If these claims are true, Moscow will be feeling frustrated that the finest weapons from its missile fleet is now able to be intercepted. This is in large part due to the arrival of modern Western defence systems, including Patriots.
Russia claimed that it destroyed a Patriot system during Tuesday's attack on Kyiv. Ukraine declined to comment. The BBC cannot independently verify the claims made by either country.
