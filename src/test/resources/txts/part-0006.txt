her speed on Monday. But for the Titanic Monday never came. FIRE INTHE COAL BUNKERSUnknown to the passengers, the Titanic was on fire from the day she sailedfrom Southampton. Her officers and crew knew it, for they had fought thefire for days.This story, told for the first time by the survivors of the crew, was only oneof the many thrilling tales of the fateful first voyage."The Titanic sailed from Southampton on Wednesday, April 10th, at noon,"said J. Dilley, fireman on the Titanic."I was assigned to the Titanic from the Oceanic, where I had served as afireman. From the day we sailed the Titanic was on fire, and my sole duty,together with eleven other men, had been to fight that fire. We had made noheadway against it."PASSENGERS IN IGNORANCE"Of course," he went on, "the passengers knew nothing of the fire. Do youthink we'd have let them know about it? No, sir."The fire started in bunker No. 6. There were hundreds of tons of coalstored there. The coal on top of the bunker was wet, as all the coal shouldhave been, but down at the bottom of the bunker the coal had beenCHAPTER III 24permitted to get dry."The dry coal at the bottom of the pile took fire, and smoldered for days.The wet coal on top kept the flames from coming through, but down in thebottom of the bunkers the flames were raging."Two men from each watch of stokers were tolled off, to fight that fire. Thestokers worked four hours at a time, so twelve of us were fighting flamesfrom the day we put out of Southampton until we hit the iceberg."No, we didn't get that fire out, and among the stokers there was talk thatwe'd have to empty the big coal bunkers after we'd put our passengers off inNew York, and then call on the fire-boats there to help us put out the fire."The stokers were alarmed over it, but the officers told us to keep ourmouths shut--they didn't want to alarm the passengers."USUAL DIVERSIONUntil Sunday, April 14th, then, the voyage had apparently been a delightfulbut uneventful one. The passengers had passed the time in the usualdiversions of ocean travelers, amusing themselves in the luxurious saloons,promenading on the boat deck, lolling at their ease in steamer chairs andmaking pools on the daily runs of the steamship. The smoking rooms andcard rooms had been as well patronized as usual, and a party of severalnotorious professional gamblers had begun reaping their usual easy harvest.As early as Sunday afternoon the officers of the Titanic must have knownthat they were approaching dangerous ice fields of the kind that are aperennial menace to the safety of steamships following the regulartransatlantic lanes off the Great Banks of Newfoundland.AN UNHEEDED WARNINGOn Sunday afternoon the Titanic's wireless operator forwarded to theHydrographic office in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and elsewhereCHAPTER III 25the following dispatch:"April 14.--The German steamship Amerika (Hamburg- American Line)reports by radio-telegraph passing two large icebergs in latitude 41.27,longitude 50.08.--Titanic, Br. S. S."Despite this warning, the Titanic forged ahead Sunday night at her usualspeed--from twenty-one to twenty-five knots.CHAPTER III 26CHAPTER IVSOME OF THE NOTABLE PASSENGERSSKETCHES OF PROMINENT MEN AND WOMEN ON BOARD,INCLUDING MAJOR ARCHIBALD BUTT, JOHN JACOB ASTOR,BENJAMIN GUGGENHEIM, ISIDOR STRAWS, J.

Though the major part ofher passengers were Americans returning from abroad, there were enrolledupon her cabin lists some of the most distinguished names of England, aswell as of the younger nation. Many of these had purposely delayed sailing,or had hastened their departure, that they might be among the firstpassengers on the great vessel.There were aboard six men whose fortunes ran into tens of millions,
