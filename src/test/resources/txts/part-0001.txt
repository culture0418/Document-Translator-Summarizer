Problem1: WaPT simulates the wake of a wind turbine, which allows the optimization of the positioning and operation of the turbines in a wind farm. It also provides the temporal evolution of the forces experienced by the blades, required for fatigue evaluation.  Problem2: All of these factors also change depending on location of the site. Wind speed must also be in a certain range (depending on the turbine), above 3.5 m/s in order to generate electricity, and below 25 m/s to avoid damage to the turbine. When taking multiple wind farm's intermittency into consideration, it would make sense that the reliability would somewhat increase, but this actually doesn't appear to be the case.  Problem3: In order to generate greater amount of energy, wind turbines are required to be designed in large dimensions. Greater blade dimensions pose a deadly threat to airborne animals especially during the active season of bat and the occurrence of bird migration. Hence, we suggest the implementation of ultrasonic devices to chase wildlife away from the turbine.  Problem4: By covering a wind turbine blade with a material similar to a wedding veil, The structure of an owl's wing serves to reduce noise by smoothing the passage of air as it passes over the wing, scattering the sound.
